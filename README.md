# Tagger
## A basic music organisation program

This music organisation system is built on the concept of 'tagging' songs, and allows the user to create and edit playlists easily by specifying tags to include. So, rather than adding songs to a playlist individually like a normal music system, many songs can be added and removed in bulk.

The purpose of this project was for me to re-fresh my memory of Java, as it used to be the progamming language I was most comfortable with but I hadn't used it for a couple of years before this. So to get me back up to speed, I decided to write a little program and try to cram-in as many different programming concepts as possible. This includes:

- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Singleton classes
- Generics
- Method overloading
- Exception handling
- Junit testing
- Input/output to file
- Input/output to console

After including as many concepts as possible in such a simple program, multiple redundencies emerged. Also, certain parts aren't implemented in very efficient ways, and the testing is far from extensive.

**The goal was to produce a Java cheat-sheet in the form of a single program, *not* to create a well produced music organisation system.**
