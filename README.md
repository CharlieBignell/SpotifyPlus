## A basic music-organisation program

The main purpose of this project was for me to re-fresh my memory of Java, as it was the progamming language I was most comfortbal with but I hadn't used it for a couple of years before this. So to get me back up to speed, I decided to write a little program and try to cram-in as many different programming concepts as possible. This includes:

- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Singleton classes
- Method overloading
- Exception handling
- Junit testing
- Input/output to file
- Input/output to console

After including as many concepts as possible in such a simple program, there are multiple reducndencies, and certain parts aren't implemented in the most efficient way.
